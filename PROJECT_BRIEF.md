# HindiVoice-AI-Assistant- Project Brief

## 1. Technologies/APIs Used and Why

### Core Technologies

| Technology | Purpose | Why Chosen |
|------------|---------|------------|
| **Python 3.11** | Programming language | AI ecosystem, extensive libraries, active community |
| **Streamlit** | Web UI framework | Fast prototyping, built-in audio/video widgets, easy cloud deployment |
| **Google Speech Recognition** | Speech-to-Text (STT) | Free tier, excellent Hindi support (hi-IN), easy integration |
| **gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech)** | Text-to-Speech (TTS) | Free, high-quality Hindi voices, simple API, no credentials needed |
| **OpenCV (Headless)** | Face detection | Robust computer vision, mature library, pre-trained models |
| **OpenAI GPT-3.5** | Advanced responses | Intelligent conversational AI, optional for complex queries |

### Why These Choices?

1. **Google APIs for Speech**: Free tier with 50+ requests/day, excellent Hindi accuracy, no authentication complexity
2. **Streamlit**: No frontend skills needed, auto-deployment to cloud, built-in widgets for audio playback
3. **Python 3.11**: Balances modern features with library compatibility (Python 3.13 missing `aifc` for speech_recognition)
4. **OpenCV Headless**: Removes GUI dependencies for cloud deployment while maintaining computer vision capabilities
5. **Hybrid Response System**: Rule-based (fast, free) + optional LLM (intelligent, cost-effective)

### Architecture Decision

**Modular Design**: Separate classes for STT, TTS, Response Generation, and Face Detection
- Easy to test individually
- Replace components without breaking others
- Clear separation of concerns

### Cloud Deployment (Streamlit)

1. **Push to GitHub**: Your repo is at `github.com/tanu91112/HindiVoice-AI-Assistant`
2. **Deploy on Streamlit Cloud**:
   - Go to https://share.streamlit.io
   - Click "New app" → Connect GitHub
   - Select repository and branch (main)
   - Python version: 3.11 (auto-configured via `runtime.txt`)
   - Advanced settings → Secrets (optional): Add `OPENAI_API_KEY` if using LLM mode
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Access**: Your app will be live at `https://[your-app].streamlit.app`

### Quick Test

After running locally or deploying:

1. **Upload Audio**: Upload `sample_audio/hindi_test.wav`
2. **See Result**: Transcription → Response → Audio playback
3. **Try Text**: Type "नमस्ते, आप कैसे हैं?" in text box
4. **View History**: Scroll to see conversation history

## 3. Challenges Faced and How You Solved Them

### Challenge 1: Python 3.13 Compatibility

**Problem**: SpeechRecognition library imports `aifc` module, which was removed in Python 3.13.

**Solution**:
- Created `runtime.txt` with `3.11` to pin Python version
- Python 3.11 has `aifc` and works with all dependencies
- This is a permanent fix for Streamlit Cloud deployments

### Challenge 2: OpenCV Import Error in Cloud

**Problem**: `cv2` native module fails to load in headless environments without proper libraries.

**Solution**:
- Switched to `opencv-python-headless` (no GUI dependencies)
- Implemented lazy import: face detection only loads when user enables it
- Added try-except in `face_detection.py` to gracefully handle missing OpenCV
- Cloud users see friendly error message; doesn't break the app

### Challenge 3: PyGame Compilation on Cloud

**Problem**: PyGame requires SDL2 system libraries, difficult to compile in cloud environments.

**Solution**:
- Removed pygame entirely (not needed for core functionality)
- Streamlit has built-in `st.audio()` widget for playback
- Only `speak_streamlit()` method needed, which uses BytesIO
- Zero dependencies on system audio libraries

### Challenge 4: Dependency Conflict (Streamlit + NumPy)

**Problem**: 
- Streamlit 1.28.0 requires `pillow<11` and `numpy<2`
- Python 3.13 prefers newer versions
- Pyramid of conflicts in dependency resolution

**Solution**:
- Upgraded to Streamlit 1.41.1 (compatible with numpy 2.x)
- Kept Python 3.11 (best compatibility)
- Set `numpy==1.26.4` and `pillow==10.4.0` (proven stable)
- All dependencies now resolve cleanly

### Challenge 5: Hindi Language Handling

**Problem**: Ensuring proper Devanagari script display and phonetic accuracy in speech.

**Solution**:
- Used `hi-IN` language code in Google APIs
- UTF-8 encoding throughout codebase
- Tested with native Hindi speakers
- Hindi-specific error messages for better UX

### Challenge 6: Microphone Input in Cloud

**Problem**: Browser microphone access requires WebRTC and proper setup; Streamlit Cloud has limitations.

**Solution**:
- Primary input: File upload (works everywhere)
- Fallback: Text input (always works)
- Microphone: Optional, documented for local use only
- Clear messaging to users about input methods

### Challenge 7: Cost Management for LLM

**Problem**: OpenAI API costs money per request; could get expensive with high usage.

**Solution**:
- **Hybrid approach**: Rule-based matching first (instant, free)
- LLM fallback only if no rule matches
- Made LLM optional via UI toggle
- Documented token limits (150 tokens per response)
- Estimated cost: ~$0.0002 per complex query
